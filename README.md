# Desktop App for One-Time Pad (OTP) Encryption

[cite_start]This is an educational desktop application designed to demonstrate the principles of message encryption and decryption using the **One-Time Pad (OTP)** algorithm. [cite: 1, 35] [cite_start]The project was developed as an academic requirement for a Cryptography course. [cite: 3, 429]

[cite_start]The primary goal of this application is to provide a practical and interactive tool for students and users to understand how OTP works, from key generation to the final decryption process. [cite: 145, 245]

## About the Algorithm: One-Time Pad (OTP)

[cite_start]The One-Time Pad is a classical cryptography technique renowned for being theoretically unbreakable. [cite: 30, 98] [cite_start]As proven by Claude Shannon, it offers **perfect secrecy** on the condition that its core principles are strictly followed. [cite: 99, 207]

[cite_start]The encryption and decryption processes are based on a simple **XOR logical operation**. [cite: 202, 209]

### Key Principles of OTP
* [cite_start]**Random Key**: The key must be perfectly random. [cite: 204]
* [cite_start]**Same Length**: The key's length must be equal to the message's length. [cite: 205]
* [cite_start]**Single Use**: The key must never be used more than once. [cite: 206]

## ‚ú® Application Features

[cite_start]This application provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) to perform OTP operations locally. [cite: 33]

* [cite_start]**Encrypt & Decrypt Text**: Users can input plaintext to be encrypted or ciphertext to be decrypted. [cite: 187]
* [cite_start]**Automatic Key Generation**: The app can generate a cryptographically secure random key with the same length as the input message. [cite: 144, 368]
* [cite_start]**Save & Load Keys**: Users can save a generated key to a local file and load a key from a file for decryption. [cite: 262, 372, 373]
* [cite_start]**Interactive Interface**: A simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter allows users to easily perform all actions and see the results in real-time. [cite: 145, 362]
* [cite_start]**Offline Operation**: The application runs entirely offline as a standalone desktop program, requiring no internet connection. [cite: 188, 265]

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

[cite_start]The application was built using standard Python libraries, requiring no external dependencies. 

* [cite_start]**Programming Language**: **Python** (Version 3.8+). [cite: 18, 384]
* [cite_start]**GUI Library**: **Tkinter**, Python's standard GUI toolkit. [cite: 33, 218, 385]
* [cite_start]**Secure Key Generation**: Python's built-in **`secrets`** module was used to generate cryptographically strong random keys. [cite: 382, 386]
* [cite_start]**File System Interaction**: The built-in **`os`** module is used for file-related operations. [cite: 387]
